                                        <li class="answer">Our most effective program is the A360 Partnership. Kirby
                                            Aquatics partners with you throughout a full season, providing regular
                                            visits to get your operation into top shape. We begin the season with an
                                            announced visit to get a baseline assessment of all three core areas. From
                                            this visit we create a guidebook with customized, practical steps for
                                            improvement. Later, Kirby Aquatics will return throughout the season, with
                                            both announced and unannounced visits, to assess your progress. The season
                                            ends with a debriefing to include a season wrap-up, and a look forward to
                                            the next season.<br><br></li>

                                        <li class="answer">Like the 360 Partnership, the Core Partnership lasts a full
                                            season, but concentrates on just one core aspect of your operation. Perhaps
                                            you're having staffing issues and want to fix them. Maybe your
                                            administration is in shambles. Kirby Aquatics will focus our efforts on your
                                            specific issue by listening to you, understanding your needs, then providing
                                            concrete steps to move you forward. Kirby Aquatics will make several visits
                                            throughout the season to assess and tweak your improvements, to get you
                                            where you want to be, and keep you there.<br><br></li>

                                        <li class="answer">Our Step-Up Programs tackle either your entire operation, or
                                            one particular Core area. We call these programs "Step-Up" because they
                                            encompass only two visits, rather than the whole season. The visits are
                                            intended to help you step up your game from where you are, to where you want
                                            to be, in just a short time. In both Step-Up Programs, Kirby Aquatics will
                                            make an initial assessment visit to generate a baseline understanding of
                                            your issues, then provide customized guidelines with concrete steps for
                                            improvement. On our second visit, Kirby Aquatics will verify and document
                                            the steps you've taken and advise you on how to keep up the
                                            improvement.<br><br>
