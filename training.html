            <h4 class="card-title">TRAINING</h4>
            <p class="card-text">At Kirby Aquatics, we prepare lifeguards for the real-world. Lifeguarding
              is more than enforcing pool rules and getting a tan. In the US, an average of 7 children die
              each day from drowning in public pools.</p>

            <p class="card-text">We also provide custom learning opportunities geared toward your needs. Whether you're
              a new pool owner in need of hands-on instruction; you have a lifeguard staff who needs an update or custom
              lessons; or you just want to expand your capabilities... we can help you.</p>

            <p>Every Kirby Aquatics instructor has at least 20 years of front-line pool experience. We can
              leverage a wealth of expertise to teach you what you need to know, because we've
              lived it. Our lessons come from the real world, not from a textbook.</p>

            <h4>FAQs</h4><br>
            <ul>
              <li class="question">When are your lifeguard classes?</li>
              <li class="answer"><a href="classes.html">Click here for the class schedule.</a><br><br></li>

              <li class="question">How long are the lifeguard classes?</li>
              <li class="answer">Normal certification classes are a week long. You will spend 5 evenings
                in the
                classroom, about 4 hours each evening. After that, we spend a whole day in the pool on
                the weekend, usually a Saturday. Sometimes we do offer compressed classes that take only
                3
                or 4 days, usually over holiday breaks.<br><br></li>

              <li class="question">Do I have to be an awesome swimmer?</li>
              <li class="answer">The most important skill of a lifeguard is paying attention, not
                swimming. If you don't see the problem, no amount of swimming skill will help; however,
                it is important that you are comfortable in the water. We don't need varsity-level
                swimmers, but basic water skills are required. There are three swimming prerequisites
                to enter the class:<br><br></li>
              <li class="answer">1. Swim 300 yards continuously, without stopping and without touching the
                bottom.</li>
              <li class="answer">2. Starting in the water, retrieve a brick 20 yards out in ~10 feet
                of water, return 20 yards with the brick, and exit the pool; all within 1 minute and 40
                seconds. </li>
              <li class="answer">3. Tread water for 2 minutes using only legs, no hands.<br><br></li>
              <li class="question">How much does the class cost?</li>
              <li class="answer">Certification classes are $290.<br><br></li>
              <li class="question">What happens if I fail?</li>
              <li class="answer">If you fail, you may retake the class <i>in its entirety</i> one time,
                space available. After the second fail, you must restart the process, including full
                payment. No refunds will be offered under any circumstances.<br><br></li>
              <li class="question">How would I fail the class?</li>
              <li class="answer">You must complete all of the following in order to pass. Failure to meet
                <i>any</i> of these requirements will mean an automatic fail:<br><br>
              </li>
              <li class="answer">- You must complete the prerequisites listed above, as well as all water
                skills taught in the class.<br><br></li>
              <li class="answer">- You must attend <i>every minute of every class</i>. No
                exceptions.<br><br></li>
              <li class="answer">- You must pass written, multiple-choice tests covering the class
                materials.<br><br></li>
              <li class="answer">- You must be able to complete all land-based skills (First Aid, CPR,
                etc.)<br><br></li>
              <li class="answer">- Your participation in all classes must be respectful and
                enthusiastic.<br><br></li>
              <li class="question">Does Kirby Aquatics hire lifeguards or place them in jobs?</li>
              <li class="answer">We do not hire lifeguards or offer lifeguard placement, but we will do
                our best to match lifeguards and employers who reach out to us for help.<br><br></li>
              <li class="question">Does Kirby Aquatics offer "custom" classes outside the posted schedule?</li>
              <li class="answer">We will schedule custom classes for your group under certain conditions. This usually
                includes a minimum number of participants, and facilities that you provide (both classroom and
                pool).<br><br></li>
              <li class="question">How long does the certification last?</li>
              <li class="answer">Your certification will last 2 years; however, you must maintain your
                skills and readiness during those two years.<br><br></li>

              <li class="question">How is Kirby Aquatics able to certify lifeguards?</li>
              <li class="answer">Kirby Aquatics follows the American Red Cross lifeguarding program, as
                well as meeting or exceeding all standards set by the United States Lifeguard Standards
                Coalition.<br><br></li>
              <li class="question">What is included in the lifeguard certification class? Does Kirby
                Aquatics offer other classes?</li>
              <li class="answer">The Kirby Aquatics certification class includes Basic Lifeguarding, First
                Aid, CPR and AED certifications in one class. At this time, we do not offer any of these
                certifications alone, nor do we offer ancillary certifications, such as lifeguard
                instructor certification, lifeguarding refresher courses, etc.<br><br></li>
              <li class="question">Does Kirby Aquatics offer online learning options?</li>
              <li class="answer">No. At Kirby Aquatics, we believe the best way to learn is through
                interaction with experts and hands-on activity. We highly encourage participants to
                review the materials ahead of time, but all classes will be on-site, in-person.<br><br>
              </li>
              <li class="question">Are classes only for teens who want to work as lifeguards?</li>
              <li class="answer">No! We strongly encourage anyone to get certified, but especially adults who regularly
                watch children in pools and/or adults who own pools.<br><br></li>
